            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>In 2015 I went on a sponsored trip to Tanzania. The program that sponsored the trip was Kilimanjaro Initiative, andorganization that takes young adults from different parts of the world and bring them together to climb Mount Kilimanjaro,the highest mountain in Africa. Through this experience I encountered several peers of mine from different walks of life,who experienced many hardships. While sharing my life experiences, I was able to build strong relationships and evenhelp some people throughout my journey. This experience has also exposed me to the real life obstacles many peopleface all across the world, and has helped me realize that we are all going through something and may just need ahelping hand at times. *while in Tanzania I participated in a sponsored charity eventat local recreational center
